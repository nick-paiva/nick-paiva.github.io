This is a term project I wrote in Python for my intro to CS class. It utilizes mulithreading, OpenGL, and object oriented programming.

It is a city simulator that emulates the growth of a virtual city through a few simple rules. The goal of this project was not so much to create a game but to demonstrate ability with Python.
