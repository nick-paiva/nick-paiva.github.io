The HUMRS (Hardened Underwater Modular Robot Snake) project was rapidly brought from concept to working prototype in under 6 months. This robot utilized [open source ESCs](https://vesc-project.com/) and [HEBI Actuators](https://docs.hebi.us/index.html#r-series-quickstart) to speed up the design process. I designed the interface electronics that stiched everything together.

Main Features:
- Soft Start Controller for smooth capacitor charging
- Reverse voltage protection
- Auxillary DC/DC for powering cameras
- Modular connector interface to allow quick swap from copper to fiber Ethernet

### Testbed

### Control Case
I also built a splash-proof control case that integrates a power supply, computer, monitor, and other support circuitry.
