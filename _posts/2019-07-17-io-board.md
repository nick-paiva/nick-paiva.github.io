This general purpose IO board can be used to control a multitude of sensors in a small footprint. It features over 50 ports, with capabilities for analog, PWM, SPI, I2C, and more. Additionally, buffers on the board protect the main controller from ESD on the IO connectors. Each digital port can also be software-selected to either 3.3V or 5V; indicator LEDs next to each connector mark the configuration. It is easily controllable over Ethernet, and fits in a small footprint of less than 2" by 3".
