This is a small ethernet switch that I designed to fit in an existing T-Joint for a modular system.
It replaces longer, daisy chained cables and results in a star topology instead. This switch is also useful as a small footprint ethernet splitter.
Because of the chosen switch chip, the compact design could easily be modified to include up to 5 ports if necessary. 

Features:
- Wide input power supply accepts up to 60V
- 3 100BASE-TX Ethernet Ports
- Small form-factor
