The Robot Health Monitor, or RHM, is a small Cypress PSoC-based sensing and control platform with ROS integration.
The intent of this design is a small, flexible sensing platform. With this in mind, the RHM has onboard auxillary communications interfaces, analog input ports, GPIO, and a wide input power supply. With the PSoC, it is easy to modify the firmware for any particular use case. These characteristics allow it to be placed virtually anywhere and communicate with arbitrary sensors. It can fit in a 1" by 1" grid, and even chained to other boards for additional GPIO.

Features:
- Wide input power supply (4-48V) can connect to battery mains
- USB-UART and additional reconfigurable communication interfaces
- 8 general purpose inouts that can be used for analog or digital functions
- Onboard BNO085 IMU
- Small form factor (1" x 1")
- ROS compatibility
