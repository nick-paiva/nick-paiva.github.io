This board is designed to test a board with three regulators of different voltages: 5V, 12V, and 24V.

To assess the regulators, there were four main test cases:
- Open circuit test
- Load test (5A)
- Inrush current test
- Efficiency test

The tester interfaces with a HEBI Robotics IO Board, and is controllable with a Python script over Ethernet. This makes the creation and reconfiguration of tests quick and easy.
The results of each test are output to the terminal, as well as a text file labeled with the date, time, and ID of the test. If any issues with the board are found, the test exits immediately:

This testing architecture is used to make the automated testing of regulators easy. It is able to stress test the regulators in a way that would be difficult and tedious to do manually. It can toggle the regulators on and off rapidly, as well as test their integrity under varied input voltages, all without any manual intervention. The rig is also incredibly durable, with large HV rated FETs and a variable, current-limiting power supply. This is the full configuration, including power resistors:
